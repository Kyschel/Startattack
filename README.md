## startattack
/startattack doesn't exist in 1.12.1, hence this addon.
## Example
The "Attack" action from the general page in the spellbook must be present somewhere on the actionbars.

Then /startattack will work as it did in wotlk (and tbc?)
```lua
/startattack
/cast Sinister Strike
```
Included also is /stopattack
```
/cast Expose Armor
/stopattack
```
